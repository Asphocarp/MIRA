# This is a sample

You can see the raw markdown in src/test/sample.md

We can use **bold** and *italic* formatting.

## Subheading

You still get ~~to~~ see the raw markdown formatting when clicking the relevant line, or selecting the text.

Feature-1 List:

- level-0
    - level-1
        - level-2

Feature-2 Checkbox:

- [ ] asdsd
- [x] asd

Feature-3 Hyperlink & Image:

[Google](https://www.google.com) is a search engine.
![Dog](https://dog.com/dog.png) is a dog image.

Bugs:

- bug exists, like if the original text changes line, the preview text will also change line, even if hiding the url makes the line shorter.
